# OperatorToC++

OperatorToC++ is an extensible, hybrid Mathematica and C++ based tool that facilitates next steps beyond the matching of parameters between a UV model and an Effective Field Theory. It efficiently remedies the complexities within the analytical matched expressions such as those due to loop-functions and lengthy sums and products involving tensor objects. It then translates and bundles the results into C++ classes and functions which provide a convenient platform for further numerical analyses.
